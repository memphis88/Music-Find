# Music-Find

A native mobile app for iPhones that worked as a fronted for discogs.com. Specifically it allowed the search and view of music sales based on queries of artists, songs or albums. This app was developed as part of my Bachelor thesis and probably is not working any more due to API changes and updates in the iOS.
